ency to a major practice. Documented instances of technology and business solutions show that a 17 to 20% market or population share can be sufficient to cross the tipping point and scale up to become the dominant pattern (53). Some authors, however, argue that it must be the “right” share of population, including well-connected influential people, trendsetters, and other types of social leaders with a high degree of agency (38, 54). In other cases, the experts referred to the STP that would be achieved if the price of fossil-fuel–free products and services falls below that of those products and services based on fossil fuels. Table 2 presents an overview of expert elicitation results.

The candidates for social tipping elements for rapid decarbonization identified by expert elicitation
Candidates for social tipping elements	Key actors able to influence the control parameter	Main control parameter	Examples of interventions	Critical threshold in the control parameter
Climate policy enforcement	International agencies, national and local governments, political elites, industry, NGOs, business, the public	The number of regulations restricting the use of fossil fuels	A global environmental court; producer responsibility and circular economy; limiting the use of fossil fuels sector by sector; banning advertisement of fossil-fuel products; abolishing the trade in fossil fuels	Eliminating the use of fossil fuels from most of sectors and spheres of human life
n* = 42 (20%); Conf.†=3
